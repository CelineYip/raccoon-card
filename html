			<ul class="dots">
				<li><span class="bold">Sci. Name</span>: Procyon lotor (Pro Looter)</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Attack</span>: 5/20 (+5 against children)</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Dexterity</span>: 60/20</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Charisma</span>: 2/20 (+4 when bathed)</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Intimidation</span>: 5/20 (+8 while wielding knife)</li>
